9. External Files:

JavaScript File (script.js): External JavaScript file (also not provided here).
Potential Issues:
Local File Paths: Image (profile-pic) and project links (like Calculator.pdf, Landing page.pdf, etc.) use local file paths (e.g., c:\Users\User\Desktop\PROJECTS\portfolio\IMG_20250204_234217.jpg). These will not work for others unless uploaded to a web server or replaced with relative URLs.
Meta Tag "Harry potter": This meta tag appears unusual and does not contribute to SEO or the website’s functionality.
This code provides a solid foundation for a personal portfolio but needs proper paths for images and project files when deployed online.
